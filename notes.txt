Code Sample - Matrix Multiplication and Transposition

 

You’ve been tasked with writing a high-performance, portable linear algebra library for a client who has an awful case 
of not-invented-here syndrome. This means you must only use standard libraries (and miss out on the decades of optimizations 
in various BLAS implementations). As a start, the client has asked for just transpose and multiplication of MxN matrices.

You should demonstrate the correctness of your solution. Your solution should be well-documented so 
that it can be used and maintained by the client’s engineering staff. You are free to choose the 
underlying matrix representation and interface.

C++

Your solution should be implemented in standard C++11 (g++ or clang++ on Linux). To keep things simple, 
the library may be header-only. You may include a Makefile/CMakeLists.txt, or you may specify the compiler 
command used to compile your source file: g++ main.cpp -std=c++11 -lthread
